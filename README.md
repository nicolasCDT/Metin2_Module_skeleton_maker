# Metin2_Module_skeleton_maker

This tool allows you to create a skeleton of your Python modules generated by the C API to use the editors'
autocompletion

## Installation

You must have Python3 installed.

Modules used:

* glob
* re
* typing
* os

## Configuration
You can now configure some parameters like the use of the snake case for
method arguments in **CONSTANTS.py** (skeleton_maker folder).

## How to use :
Execute the main script by doing `python main.py --help` to see the options

## Next Steps ?
To continue, you can use [VegaS](https://github.com/Vegas007/)'s script to convert your python2 code to python3 : [Script here](https://github.com/Vegas007/Python-Code-Translator-2-to-3). 
This will adapt your code to be usable both in python2 and python 3
